# Data Structures in Python
**Authors: James Salamonsen, James Feore**

This repo holds sample code for the implementation of a number of classic data structures in Python.

*Linked List:*
No resources referenced for this one, other than our previous linked list work.

*Stack:*
Implemented a stack push and pop methods. It also interacts with the len() function.

*Doubly Linked List:*
Implemented a DLL with push, pop, shift, append, remove, and len() functionality.

*Queue:*
Implemented a queue as a composition of a DLL. It has enqueue, dequeue, len(), and peek functionality.

*Binary Heap*
Implemented a binary heap as a min heap. It has pop and push functions that bubbles down the list. Referenced https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Binary%20Heaps/heaps.html

*Priority Queue*
Implemented a priority queue based off our binary heap. It has a insert, pop and peek function.

*Unweighted Directed Graph*
Implemented a graph data structure.  It uses the following functions: node, edges, add_node, add_edge, del_node, del_edge.
